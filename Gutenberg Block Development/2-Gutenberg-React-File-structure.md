# 🚀 How to Build a Custom Gutenberg Block with React (The Ultimate File-by-File Guide)

Ever felt overwhelmed by Gutenberg block development? 😰

You’re not alone.

With all the folders, files, and build tools flying around… it’s easy to get lost.

But today, I’m breaking it down — file by file — so you not only **understand** what each part does, but also know **how to use it in real-world WordPress projects**. Whether you're freelancing or building your next plugin, this guide is your shortcut.

Let’s dive in. 🛠️

## 🧠 Why Gutenberg Blocks Matter

Gutenberg isn't "just a new editor." It’s **how WordPress is evolving**.

And if you’re a developer, mastering custom blocks with React isn’t optional — it’s essential. Blocks give you:
- Full control of the editor UI
- Reusable components
- Clean separation between design and logic

Once you get the hang of it, you’ll wonder how you lived without it.

## 📁 Deep Dive Into the Gutenberg Block Folder Structure

Let’s break down the anatomy of a Gutenberg block project. 👇

### 1. **`build/` — The Production Bundle**
This folder gets auto-generated when you run `npm run build`. It contains compiled JavaScript and CSS files, optimized for browsers.  
✅ *You should NEVER manually edit anything here.*

---

### 2. **`node_modules/` — All Your Dependencies**
Once you run `npm install`, this folder fills up with everything your block needs — from React to Webpack.  
✅ *Ignore it in Git. It’s huge.*

---

### 3. **`src/` — Where the Magic Happens**
Here’s where you write your block using **React + JSX**.

- **`edit.js`** → What the block looks like in the editor (backend).
- **`save.js`** → How it renders on the frontend.
- **`index.js`** → Registers the block.

💡 *Write clean, modular components here.*

---

### 4. **`.editorconfig` — Keep Your Formatting Consistent**
This file sets basic rules (like indentation, charset) for all developers working on the block.  
✅ *Helps avoid code formatting issues when collaborating.*

---

### 5. **`blockname.php` — The PHP Bridge**
Used to register the block in WordPress. This includes:
- Registering the scripts and styles
- Linking them to your block

💡 *Think of it as the "glue" between WordPress and your React code.*

---

### 6. **`package.json` — The Project’s Brain**
Defines everything from:
- Project name
- Dependencies
- Build commands (`npm run build`, `npm start`, etc.)

💡 *Edit this carefully. It powers your whole workflow.*

---

### 7. **`package-lock.json` — Dependency Snapshot**
Locks the exact versions of dependencies.  
✅ *Ensures every developer uses the same versions.*

---

### 8. **`readme.txt` — WordPress-Ready Plugin Info**
If you're submitting to the plugin repo, this file is **non-negotiable**.  
It contains plugin descriptions, install steps, and changelogs.

💡 *Use Markdown-friendly formatting for best results.*

---

### 9. **`block.json` — The Block Manifest (Gutenberg’s Favorite)**
Introduced in WP 5.5, this file declares:
- Block name
- Category
- Attributes
- Scripts/styles it depends on

💡 *Reduces PHP code. Core now registers blocks automatically from this.*

---

### 10. **`style.scss` — Frontend Styles**
These styles are what site visitors see.

Use BEM naming or scoped classes to avoid conflicts.

---

### 11. **`editor.scss` — Editor-Specific Styles**
These styles only affect the Gutenberg editor.

💡 *Keep the backend clean and pixel-perfect for your clients.*

## 🧰 Use Cases: When You Should Build Custom Blocks

Here’s when custom blocks make sense:
- ✅ Building reusable content layouts for clients
- ✅ Creating unique call-to-action blocks
- ✅ Integrating third-party APIs (like weather, maps, etc.)
- ✅ Custom product components in WooCommerce
- ✅ Advanced form blocks with custom logic

If your project requires dynamic functionality, structured content, or branded designs — **blocks are the answer**.

## ✅ Conclusion: Time to Build Like a Pro

Now that you know what each file does and how it all fits together…

You’re no longer guessing.

With this structure in mind, you can build high-performance blocks that impress your clients and elevate your WordPress game. 💼
