# Gutenberg Block Development with React: Deep Dive into `useBlockProps` 🧱⚛️

If you’re building custom Gutenberg blocks with React, you’ve probably come across `useBlockProps`. At first glance, it might seem like just another hook — but it’s a fundamental tool that ties your custom block into the Gutenberg editor seamlessly.

In this article, we’ll explore:

✅ What `useBlockProps` is  
✅ Why it’s important  
✅ How it works under the hood  
✅ Real-world use cases  
✅ Advanced usage (merging props, dynamic classNames, etc.)  
✅ Best practices

`useBlockProps` adds default block wrapper props, like styling and block ID, from WordPress. It’s like saying, “Hey WordPress, this is a block!”

In simple terms:
👉 useBlockProps() is a WordPress helper function that gives your block the necessary HTML properties (like className, style, data-*) so it looks and behaves correctly inside the block editor.

🧩 Why do you need it? Think of WordPress blocks like Lego pieces. Each block needs:

- A specific shape (CSS class)
- An identity (HTML attributes)
- Editor styling hooks

Without those, your block:
- May not display styles properly
- Might not be selectable or draggable
- Won’t work well with other blocks

So useBlockProps() gives your block the standard "Lego connectors" to fit nicely with the others in the editor.

## 🧠 What is `useBlockProps`?

The `useBlockProps` **hook** is part of the WordPress Block Editor’s React-based development system (also known as Gutenberg). It provides the necessary props (HTML attributes and event handlers) to integrate your custom block with the block editor's UI and behavior.

📦 Imported from:  
```js
import { useBlockProps } from '@wordpress/block-editor';
```

It ensures your block gets:

- Default classes (`wp-block-your-block-name`) ❗️
- Keyboard accessibility ❗️
- Proper DOM structure for selection, editing, and toolbar integration ❗️
- Styles handled automatically by the editor ❗️

---

#### In your code:

```js
<div {...useBlockProps()}>
  {/* your block content */}
</div>
```

**This means:**
- "Give me the default props for a block"
- "Apply them to this using the spread operator (...)"

So your block becomes:
✅ Selectable
✅ Styled properly
✅ Compatible with other blocks

#### You can add your own class or styles like this 👇
```php
const blockProps = useBlockProps({
  className: 'my-slider-block',
  style: { backgroundColor: 'lightgray' }
});
```

Then use 👇
```js
<div {...blockProps}>...</div>
```

## 🎯 Why is `useBlockProps` Important?

Before `useBlockProps`, developers had to manually add classes and data attributes to align with the editor’s internal systems.

This created issues like:

- Inconsistent styling 🙁
- Broken block selection 🙁
- Misaligned UI 🙁
- No drag-and-drop support 🙁

***With `useBlockProps`, WordPress solves this by giving us a consistent hook that returns essential block properties (attributes, class names, and ARIA roles), so we don’t have to worry about it.*** 🤩

> It connects your block's React component to the block editor’s internal mechanisms.

---

## 🔧 Basic Usage Example

Here’s how it works in a simple block:

```js
import { useBlockProps } from '@wordpress/block-editor';

export default function Edit(props) {
	const blockProps = useBlockProps();

	return (
		<div {...blockProps}>
			<p>Hello, Gutenberg!</p>
		</div>
	);
}
```

The `{...blockProps}` spreads all the necessary editor props onto the root element. This enables selection, block toolbar controls, styles, and more.

---

## 🛠️ Custom Class Names and Styles

You can merge additional class names, styles, and attributes into the default block props like this:

```js
const blockProps = useBlockProps({
	className: 'custom-hello-world',
	style: { backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0', padding: '20px' },
});
```

Result in DOM:

```html
<div class="wp-block-my-block custom-hello-world" style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 20px;">
```

This keeps your styles modular and compliant with editor expectations.

---

## 🪄 useBlockProps.save() for Frontend Output

When saving the block's markup for the frontend, WordPress provides a variant:

```js
import { useBlockProps } from '@wordpress/block-editor';

export default function save() {
	return (
		<div {...useBlockProps.save()}>
			<p>Hello on the frontend!</p>
		</div>
	);
}
```

This ensures the block retains its classes and structure in the final saved content.

---

## 🧩 Advanced Use Cases

### ✅ Conditional Class Names

```js
const blockProps = useBlockProps({
	className: isActive ? 'active-block' : 'inactive-block',
});
```

### ✅ Merging with Tailwind or CSS Modules

```js
const blockProps = useBlockProps({
	className: `my-custom-block ${styles.myBlockClass}`,
});
```

### ✅ Nested Blocks (InnerBlocks + useBlockProps)

```js
import { useBlockProps, InnerBlocks } from '@wordpress/block-editor';

export default function Edit() {
	const blockProps = useBlockProps();

	return (
		<div {...blockProps}>
			<InnerBlocks />
		</div>
	);
}
```

This is key for container blocks like columns, groups, or custom layouts.

---

## 🧪 Under the Hood: What Does `useBlockProps` Actually Return?

It typically returns:

```js
{
	className: 'wp-block-my-plugin-my-block custom-class',
	ref: React ref object,
	'data-block': 'block-id',
	tabIndex: 0,
	role: 'textbox',
	...more accessibility and editor-specific props
}
```

These are crucial for accessibility, editor integration, selection behaviors, and more.

---

## ✅ Best Practices for `useBlockProps`

- ✅ Always wrap your block’s root element with it ❗️❗️❗️
- ✅ Use `useBlockProps.save()` in `save.js` for frontend parity ❗️❗️❗️
- ✅ Merge custom styles or class names without overwriting defaults ❗️❗️❗️
- ❌ Don’t apply it to child elements — only the block’s root container ❗️❗️❗️
- ✅ Use it even if you’re not styling anything — it’s required for proper editor behavior ❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️

---

## 📌 Summary

`useBlockProps` might seem small, but it’s *critical* to building modern, compatible Gutenberg blocks. It’s the glue that connects your JSX to the WordPress editor system — from keyboard navigation and selection to drag-and-drop support and default styling.

By understanding how to properly use and extend it, you’ll be writing better, cleaner, and more editor-compliant blocks in no time.
