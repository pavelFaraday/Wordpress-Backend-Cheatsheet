# Gutenberg Block Development with React: Static Block vs Dynamic Block 🔍

The Gutenberg editor revolutionized WordPress by introducing a **block-based editing experience**. At its core, this system relies on React-powered blocks that let users build complex layouts with ease. But when you're developing custom blocks, you're likely to face a key decision:

**Should you build a Static Block or a Dynamic Block?**

Understanding the differences between these two is critical for building performant, scalable, and maintainable WordPress solutions.

## 🎯 Purpose of Gutenberg Blocks

Gutenberg blocks allow developers to create reusable content elements within the WordPress editor. These blocks abstract content and layout into modular components, offering a clean and user-friendly editing experience.

But not all blocks are the same — and that’s where the distinction between **static** and **dynamic** blocks becomes essential.

## 🧱 What is a Static Block?

❗️❗️❗️A **Static Block** is rendered entirely on the **client-side**. All data and output are stored directly in the <u>**post content (HTML)**</u> when the user saves the post.Static Blocks don’t require backend logic or server-rendered content. ❗️❗️❗️ 

### 🔧 How it Works

* ❗️Defined using JavaScript (typically with React).
* ❗️The block’s structure and content are serialized into HTML and saved to the **post\_content**.
* ❗️Doesn’t require a PHP render callback.
* ❗️Uses `save()` function in block registration.
* ❗️Rendering happens in the **editor** and on the **frontend**, using the same block definition.

```js
// registerBlockType example for a static block
registerBlockType('my-plugin/static-block', {
  title: 'Static Block',
  icon: 'smiley',
  category: 'common',

  attributes: {
    content: { type: 'string' },
  },

  edit: ({ attributes, setAttributes }) => {
    return (
      <input
        type="text"
        value={attributes.content}
        onChange={(e) => setAttributes({ content: e.target.value })}
      />
    );
  },

  save: ({ attributes }) => {
    return <p>{attributes.content}</p>;
  },
});
```

### ✅ Use Cases

* Simple content blocks (text, headings, buttons).
* Blocks that don’t require backend logic or server-rendered content.
* Performance-focused layouts.

## ⚙️ What is a Dynamic Block?

❗️❗️❗️ A **Dynamic Block** is rendered on the **server-side**, using **PHP**. ❗️❗️❗️
The output is generated each time the block is rendered on the frontend.

### 🔧 How it Works

* JavaScript controls the editor experience. ❗️
* On save, a placeholder comment (`<!-- wp:namespace/block-name {"attr":"value"} /-->`) is saved to the post content. ❗️
* PHP callback generates the HTML output during page load. ❗️

* ❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️**Uses `render_callback` in PHP**❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️.
* ❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️`save()` **function in JS returns** `null`❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️
* ❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️**Attributes are passed from the editor to the server via the block comment** ❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️

```php
// PHP: register block with render callback
register_block_type('my-plugin/dynamic-block', [
    'render_callback' => 'my_plugin_render_dynamic_block',
]);

function my_plugin_render_dynamic_block($attributes) {
    return '<p>' . esc_html($attributes['content']) . '</p>';
}
```

```js
// JS: save function returns null
registerBlockType('my-plugin/dynamic-block', {
  title: 'Dynamic Block',
  icon: 'admin-site',
  category: 'widgets',

  attributes: {
    content: { type: 'string' },
  },

  edit: ({ attributes, setAttributes }) => {
    return (
      <textarea
        value={attributes.content}
        onChange={(e) => setAttributes({ content: e.target.value })}
      />
    );
  },

  save: () => {
    return null; // Rendering handled by PHP
  },
});
```

### ✅ Use Cases

* Blocks that display **dynamic content** from the database.
* Real-time data (latest posts, user info, comments).
* Integration with external APIs.
* Conditional content rendering.

## 🤔 Static vs Dynamic: Key Differences ❗️❗️❗️

| Feature        | Static Block                    | Dynamic Block                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Rendering      | Client-side (JS)                | Server-side (PHP)                 |
| Saved Content  | HTML in post\_content           | Block comment in post\_content    |
| Flexibility    | Limited                         | High                              |
| Performance    | High (cached HTML)              | Varies (based on server load)     |
| Ideal Use Case | Layout elements, simple content | Real-time, user-based, API-driven |
| Backend Code   | Not needed                      | Required                          |

## 🛠️ In Practice: When to Use Each

### 📝 Use Static Blocks When:

* You’re building visual design elements like sections, containers, or stylized text.
* The block’s output never changes once saved.
* You want fast rendering with no extra PHP.

**Examples**: Hero banners, testimonials, calls-to-action.

---

### 🧠 Use Dynamic Blocks When:

* You need access to dynamic or personalized data.
* Content changes based on time, user role, or external input.
* Output depends on server-side logic (e.g. pulling posts or WooCommerce products).

**Examples**: Latest blog posts, event calendars, user profiles, post meta.

## 🧪 Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds?

You can also mix both approaches by using:

* Static HTML for simple layouts.
* Dynamic rendering via PHP for specific blocks.
* Even integrating REST API calls in `edit()` or `useEffect()` to preview dynamic data in the editor.

Example:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?per_page=3')
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => setPosts(data));
}, []);
```

## ⚡ Pro Tips for Developers

* Use **`@wordpress/create-block`** to scaffold block plugins quickly.
* Leverage **React hooks** like `useState`, `useEffect` for custom logic.
* For dynamic blocks, keep `render_callback` efficient — avoid heavy DB queries.
* Use **InspectorControls** to offer rich customization UI inside the block editor.
* Always sanitize and validate data in PHP callbacks to prevent XSS or injection.

---

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

Both static and dynamic blocks are powerful tools in Gutenberg’s ecosystem. The right choice depends on your **use case, performance needs**, and **data sources**.

* Use **static blocks** when you prioritize performance and simplicity.
* Choose **dynamic blocks** when your block must react to changing or server-side data.

By mastering both, you’ll unlock the full potential of modern WordPress block development with React.
