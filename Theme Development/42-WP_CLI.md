## ðŸ“Œ WP-CLI

The WordPress Command Line Interface (WP-CLI) is a powerful tool that enables developers and administrators to interact with WordPress directly through the command line. Below is a detailed breakdown of its purpose, core concepts, and practical use cases.

---

### **Purpose of WP-CLI**
WP-CLI streamlines WordPress development and management by offering a fast and efficient way to perform tasks that would otherwise require navigating the WordPress dashboard. Its primary purposes include:

- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks like plugin updates or content imports.
- **Efficiency**: Execute tasks in bulk with less time compared to the web interface.
- **Scripting**: Integrate WordPress management into shell scripts for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Accessibility**: Manage WordPress installations on headless servers where no GUI is available.

### **Core Concepts of WP-CLI**
1. **Commands**:
   WP-CLI operates via a set of commands. Each command has its own subcommands and flags for customization.
   - Example: `wp plugin install` or `wp theme activate`.

2. **Arguments and Options**:
   - Arguments are additional inputs provided to commands.
     Example: `wp plugin install woocommerce`
   - Options modify the behavior of commands using flags.
     Example: `wp plugin install woocommerce --activate`

3. **Global Parameters**:
   Certain parameters can apply to all commands, such as:
   - `--path=<path>`: Specify the WordPress installation path.
   - `--url=<url>`: Define the target site when managing multisite installations.

4. **Custom Scripts**:
   Developers can extend WP-CLI by writing custom commands using PHP.

5. **Interactive Shell**:
   Use WP-CLI as an interactive environment to test and execute commands live.
