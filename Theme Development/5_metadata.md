   - **Meta Description:** A brief summary of the page or post that appears in search engine results.
   - **Meta Keywords:** Keywords that help define the content for search engines (though not as commonly used anymore).

#### 7. Custom Metadata
   - **Custom Fields:** Extra fields that allow you to add personalized data to a post, user, or taxonomy (e.g., product prices, event dates).

#### 10. Plugin-Related Metadata
   - Many plugins store metadata for their specific functionality (e.g., WooCommerce product metadata like price, SKU, inventory count, etc.).

Metadata plays a significant role in organizing, categorizing, and managing content in WordPress. It is essential not just for site management but also for SEO optimization and content discoverability.
