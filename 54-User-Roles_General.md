## 📌 **User Roles in WordPress: A Detailed Guide**  

WordPress user roles are a fundamental component of its content management system (CMS). They determine what each user can and cannot do within your website. Understanding user roles is crucial for managing permissions effectively, ensuring security, and streamlining workflows.

### **Core Concepts of WordPress User Roles**  

- **Roles**: Predefined sets of permissions assigned to a user. Examples include Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, and Subscriber.  
- **Capabilities**: Specific permissions that dictate actions users can perform, such as editing posts, managing plugins, or moderating comments.  

Roles are essentially a grouping of capabilities. For example, an Author has the capability to write and publish their posts but cannot manage plugins or themes.
